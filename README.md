## index.html
I started by creating an index html by building its title called the 'Shopping List'.
In the body I created a header known as the shopping list then created a div id and nested an input, a set of buttons and an unranked list. I finished by linking my script.js file.

## script.js
I started by declaring a variable called a shopping list and creating an empty array that will store the shopping list items.I proceeded to declare the DOM elements by referring to their id name.I proceeded to declare an event listener for adding a new item, for marking an item as purchased and for clearing the list . I proceeded to create a function whose purpose is to add a new item to the list. I created another function whose purpose was to render the shopping list. I proceeded to add a button to mar item as purchased when they were purchased by using the .createElement(). I then created a function to toggle the purchased status of an item in the shopping list. I proceeded to then create a function that was to clear the shopping list when the button clear list was pressed.I finished by creating a function that was to save the shopping list created to a local storage.

## style.css
I started by styling a visual indication of the purchased items by crossing a line through it once it is marked as purchased and changing the color to grey. I then changed the heading color to lightblue for a colorful presentation. I then changed the whole background colour to pink as I thought it was a user friendly colour.
